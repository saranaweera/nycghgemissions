# NYC Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis

Check out my blog post on this analysis [here](https://saranaweera.github.io/2017-03-15-NYC-GHG/)

## Background

The cornerstone of NYC’s climate change policy is the goal of “80 by 50”, an 80% reduction in greenhouses gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2050. Of citywide greenhouse gas emissions in the baseline year of 2005, 68% can be attributed to buildings, 27% to transportation and 5% to waste. For my analysis, I decided to take a deep dive into the 68% of emissions from buildings. This covers the energy used to power, heat, and cool buildings, which includes emissions from burning fossil fuels both onsite (for heat and hot water), and in power plants (to generate electricity).

## Data
There are now four years of data from local law 84 (2011 through 2014) available through the [NYC Open Data platform](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Energy-and-Water-Data-Disclosure-for-Local-Law-84-/q39e-7gbs).
